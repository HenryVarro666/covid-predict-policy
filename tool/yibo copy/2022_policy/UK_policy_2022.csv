Attendances at football and rugby matches had been limited to 500 people under rules which were introduced as cases of the Omicron variant surged across the country.    Large outdoor events can resume without physical distancing or capacity limits from 00:01 on Monday 17 January, following a review of all measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).    To support the lifting of capacity limits on outdoor events, COVID certification will remain for these where more than 4,000 standing or 10,000 seated are in attendance, and all other events and venues previously covered. Organisers of all events with more than 1,000 attendees will be expected to check a minimum of 50% of attendees for certification of vaccination, exemption, or negative test.

From 28 February 2022, face coverings are no longer routinely recommended in classrooms. Face coverings should however be worn by staff visitors, and secondary aged learners when moving around indoor communal areas outside the classroom, such as corridors, where physical distance cannot be maintained. If anyone wishes to wear a face covering for personal reasons anywhere in the school they should be permitted to do so. This may help support their wider well-being, reduce anxiety and provide additional reassurance for some individuals alongside other mitigating measures.    Face coverings continue to be recommended to be worn by secondary aged learners on school transport.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220315230941/https://gov.wales/schools-coronavirus-guidance#section-78764",0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,816387.0,6983.0,17.59,17.59,25.0,25.0,33.85,33.85,35.12,35.12,25.0,25.0
