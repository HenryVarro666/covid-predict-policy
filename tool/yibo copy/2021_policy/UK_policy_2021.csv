The scheme allows employers to keep staff on the payroll but without them coming to work, with the Government paying 80 per cent of their salaries, up to a maximum cap of £2,500.    From 1 July, the Government has reduced its support from 80 per cent of employees’ wages to 70 per cent.    Employers will then have to top up the remaining 10 per cent, so staff still receive 80 per cent of their salaries.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210630172019/https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/work/furlough-when-end-hmrc-scheme-changes-july-2021-new-rules-how-long-finish-explained-1079553",2.0,,0.0,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,3.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,,,,2.0,,2.0,,16-19 yrs,16-19 yrs,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,,4828463.0,128162.0,51.39,51.39,63.81,63.81,63.8,63.8,58.63,58.63,100.0,100.0

The scheme is seen as a way of allowing events to go ahead despite surging cases of Covid-19, avoid re-imposing wider restrictions, and encouraging the uptake of the vaccine in younger people.    While the law came into effect from 1 October, it will not be formally enforced until 18 October to give venues time to test out their procedures.      https://web.archive.org/web/20211011105341/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58422607",3.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,3.0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,,2.0,0.0,,,,2.0,,3.0,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,,8497868.0,138629.0,46.76,46.76,53.57,53.57,50.0,50.0,53.57,53.57,25.0,25.0

As of tomorrow, 15 December, people arriving from 11 African countries will no longer need to stay in one of the government-run quarantine hotels.    People currently in a UK quarantine hotel will also be allowed to leave early, as long as they do not test positive for COVID-19.    However all current testing requirements will remain in place, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed on Twitter this afternoon.    he UK recently updated its travel rules, stipulating that all arrivals must now show a negative pre-departure PCR or lateral flow test that was taken within 48 hours of arriving.    This is in addition to a day 2 PCR test, which both UK citizens and visitors must await the results of in isolation.

They will be allowed out for visits to gardens, parks and beaches from Tuesday without being forced to self-isolate upon their return.    The latest move to relax the restrictions on the estimated 420,000 people living in English care homes was announced as coronavirus rates continue to fall across the country. Almost 95 per cent of residents have received their first dose of the vaccine, while 71 per cent have been jabbed twice.    They remain forbidden for the moment to go out in groups or to meet more than one person at a time outdoors, although this restriction could be further loosened later this month.    Visits indoors, apart from to use toilet facilities, remain banned and people are urged to avoid taking public transport if possible.

The step aligns France with the rest of the amber list now that the proportion of beta variant cases has fallen, where those who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised and administered in the UK, US or Europe do not need to quarantine when arriving in England.    This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",2.0,1.0,,2.0,,0.0,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,2.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5404913.0,114278.0,23.15,23.15,32.14,32.14,43.49,43.49,35.42,35.42,100.0,100.0

Version 10 of the guidance supersedes previous versions. The key changes are:    To introduce ‘essential visitors’. Each resident can now nominate an essential visitor. The essential visitor may visit the resident regularly indoors during a COVID-19 outbreak at the care home provided the resident or visitor do not themselves have COVID-19 (unless there are exceptional circumstances). This will ensure that people can continue to benefit from regular visits by a nominated essential visitor when wider restrictions on routine visits maybe in place.      To remove the limit of two indoor visitors at the same time per resident. This will now be subject to a risk assessment by the care home.  To remove the need for visitors to wear face coverings in outdoor areas of the care home.   To amend requirements on use of face coverings in indoor areas.   To clarify that indoor visits can take place in residents’ rooms as well as in a designated visiting space.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210811111305/https://gov.wales/visits-care-homes-guidance-providers-html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,247930.0,5623.0,23.15,23.15,32.14,32.14,40.1,40.1,38.69,38.69,,

As of tomorrow, 15 December, people arriving from 11 African countries will no longer need to stay in one of the government-run quarantine hotels.    People currently in a UK quarantine hotel will also be allowed to leave early, as long as they do not test positive for COVID-19.    However all current testing requirements will remain in place, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed on Twitter this afternoon.    he UK recently updated its travel rules, stipulating that all arrivals must now show a negative pre-departure PCR or lateral flow test that was taken within 48 hours of arriving.    This is in addition to a day 2 PCR test, which both UK citizens and visitors must await the results of in isolation. The rules vary for unvaccinated travellers.    http://web.archive.org/web/20211215095343/https://www.euronews.com/travel/2021/12/14/uk-travel-all-countries-removed-from-the-uk-s-red-quarantine-list",0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,552740.0,6501.0,38.89,38.89,53.57,53.57,45.83,45.83,48.81,48.81,25.0,25.0
