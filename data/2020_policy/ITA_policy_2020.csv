Among these, for example, family members and people with symptoms are not allowed to visit for the entire duration of the emergency; new residents can be authorized to move in after being tested for Covid-19 and must be placed in a dedicated area, isolated from other residents. Furthermore, nursing homes are recommended to avoid sending their residents to hospitals for diagnostic tests and medical visits. Group activities and the use of shared spaces are to be suspended; all staff, suppliers and maintenance workers must be properly equipped with PPE. As soon as a resident shows signs of a likely infection s/he must be isolated and tested immediately. If positive, they must be kept in isolation when structurally possible and, otherwise, transferred to an appropriately equipped facility. Special Units for Continuity of Care (for further information please see paragraph 3.2) are responsible for guaranteeing continuous communication with infectious disease specialists and protocols to be followed will be those emitted by the Directorates of each facility. Nursing homes with suspected or ascertained Covid-19 cases (even those awaiting transfer), must provide medical and nursing support 24 hours per day.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20210110070649/https://www.covid19healthsystem.org/countries/italy/countrypage.aspx ['Maintaining Essential Services']",,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,175925.0,23227.0,93.52,93.52,96.43,96.43,80.99,80.99,85.42,85.42,50.0,50.0
