The Italian government approved a new measure on Thursday that makes digital vaccine certificates compulsory for both public and private sectors.    The obligation is set to begin from October 15 and remain in force until the end of the year.    ""We are extending the obligation of the green pass to the entire world of work, public and private, and we are doing so for two essential reasons: to make these places safer and to make our vaccination campaign even stronger,"" health minister Roberto Speranza told the press.    The move aims to improve vaccine uptake and reduce the infection rate amid a potential surge in COVID-19 cases this winter.
