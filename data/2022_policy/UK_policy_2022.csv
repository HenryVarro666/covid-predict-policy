Attendances at football and rugby matches had been limited to 500 people under rules which were introduced as cases of the Omicron variant surged across the country.    Large outdoor events can resume without physical distancing or capacity limits from 00:01 on Monday 17 January, following a review of all measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).    To support the lifting of capacity limits on outdoor events, COVID certification will remain for these where more than 4,000 standing or 10,000 seated are in attendance, and all other events and venues previously covered. Organisers of all events with more than 1,000 attendees will be expected to check a minimum of 50% of attendees for certification of vaccination, exemption, or negative test.

Despite statements from councils that secondary students and staff should continue to wear face coverings in certain situations, masks won’t be mandatory.    A Scottish Government spokeswoman said councils can’t choose to require masks in schools locally.    But, with recent high case rates nationally, many councils across the north and north-east said they will continue to encourage face coverings as an optional protective measure in schools.      From 18 April 2022, there is no longer a requirement for schools to issue individual information (“warn and inform”) letters to low risk contacts when positive cases are identified, or for them to test prior to returning to the school environment provided they remain without symptoms.       http://web.archive.org/web/20220420083606/https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/    http://web.archive.org/web/20220419162325/https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/education/4150871/face-masks-schools-scotland-encouraged/",0.0,,No legal requirements to wear face coverings as of 18 April 2022    http://web.archive.org/web/20220420083606/https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/  ,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,LFTs no longer widely available so this drops to a 2    If you have COVID-19 symptoms you should isolate and book a PCR test – this advice has not changed and testing will continue until 30 April 2022.

From 28 February 2022, face coverings are no longer routinely recommended in classrooms. Face coverings should however be worn by staff visitors, and secondary aged learners when moving around indoor communal areas outside the classroom, such as corridors, where physical distance cannot be maintained. If anyone wishes to wear a face covering for personal reasons anywhere in the school they should be permitted to do so. This may help support their wider well-being, reduce anxiety and provide additional reassurance for some individuals alongside other mitigating measures.    Face coverings continue to be recommended to be worn by secondary aged learners on school transport.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220315230941/https://gov.wales/schools-coronavirus-guidance#section-78764",1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,816388.0,6983.0,26.85,26.85,41.67,41.67,39.06,39.06,41.07,41.07,25.0,25.0

Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive.    Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving.    Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday.     Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so ""reluctantly"" - and was ""extremely disappointed"" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220318104124/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60741158",0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,2.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,842885.0,7066.0,24.07,24.07,38.1,38.1,37.5,37.5,39.29,39.29,25.0,25.0
